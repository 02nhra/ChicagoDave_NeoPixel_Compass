ChicagoDave_NeoPixel_Compass
===========================
Arduino code, example, for compass made with Adafruit* NeoPixel Ring.

A video of working NeoPixel Compass can be seen on YouTube here: http://youtu.be/z4y-KiBOJ24

This project (as written for Arduino UNO) was heavily influenced by the Adafruit City Bike Helmet code. It requires one ADAFRUIT NeoPixel Ring, one LSM303 Accelerometer/Magnetometer breakout board...

...and the following libraries:

Adafruit_NeoPixel.h

Adafruit_Sensor.h

Adafruit_LSM303.h

Wire.h
